## Clean Code Tips
1. Effectiveness and Efficiency: Write code that not only works correctly but also performs well. Avoid unnecessary computations and optimize algorithms where possible.
2. Simplicity: Keep your code simple and straightforward. Avoid overcomplicating solutions; simpler code is easier to read, maintain, and debug.
3. Format & Syntax: Use consistent formatting and follow language-specific conventions. This includes proper indentation, naming conventions, and code organization.
4. Naming: Choose clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Good names help convey the purpose of the code without needing extensive comments.
5. Conciseness Vs Clarity: Strive for a balance between being concise and being clear. Avoid overly terse code that sacrifices readability.
6. Reusability: Write modular code that can be reused in different parts of the application or in future projects. This includes creating functions and classes that encapsulate specific functionality.
7. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): Each function or class should have one responsibility or purpose. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain. The class will only have one reason to change.
8. Single Source of Truth: Avoid duplicating logic or data in multiple places. Instead, centralize it so that changes only need to be made in one location.
10. Only expose & consume what is necessary: Limit the public interface of modules, classes, and functions to only what is needed. This reduces complexity and potential for misuse.
11. Modularization: Break down your code into smaller, manageable modules or components. This makes it easier to test, maintain, and understand.
12. Folder Structure: Organize your project files and folders in a logical manner. A well-structured project makes it easier to navigate and find specific components.
13. Coupling and Cohesion: Aim for low coupling (minimal dependencies between modules) and high cohesion (related functionality within a module). This improves maintainability and scalability.
14. Comments and Documentation: Use comments to explain the "why" behind complex code sections, but avoid over-commenting. Maintain up-to-date documentation for your codebase to help others (and yourself) understand its purpose and usage.
15. Testing: Write tests for your code to ensure it behaves as expected. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as appropriate.

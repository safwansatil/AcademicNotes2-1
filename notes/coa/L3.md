## ISA
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines the set of instructions that a processor can execute. It serves as the interface between software and hardware, specifying how software controls the hardware.
ISA is the contract between hardware designers and software developers.
Hardware engineers build CPU to implement ISA exactly.
Software developers (via compilers) write machine code that follows ISA rules.
You can change hardware implementation (make it faster, more power-efficient) as long as it still obeys the ISA — old software will still run.

That’s why your Windows from 10 years ago can run on a new Intel CPU — same ISA (x86-64), but inside the CPU, implementation is totally different and much faster.

ISA in a CPU is like:
It’s a list of basic operations the CPU can perform, like:

ADD R1, R2, R3 (Add R2 and R3, store result in R1)

LOAD R1, [address] (Get data from memory into register)

STORE R1, [address] (Put data from register into memory)

BRANCH IF EQUAL (Jump to another instruction if two values are equal)

The CPU hardware is built to understand only these instructions.

### Key Parts of ISA:

An ISA defines:

Instruction formats
How an instruction looks in binary (e.g., first 6 bits = opcode, next 5 bits = register number, etc.).

Operations available
What instructions exist (ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, JUMP, etc.).

Data types
What kinds of data can be processed (integers, floats) and their sizes.

Registers
How many general-purpose registers exist, their names, and special registers (like PC = Program Counter).

Addressing modes
Ways to specify where data is (in a register? in memory at address X? in memory at address in register R1 + offset? etc.).

Memory model
How memory is addressed (byte-addressable? word-addressable?).

Input/Output
How CPU communicates with peripherals — memory-mapped I/O vs. special I/O instructions.


 Real-World ISAs You Might Have Heard Of
x86 — used in Intel/AMD desktop/laptop processors (CISC type).

ARM — used in most smartphones and newer Macs (RISC type).

RISC-V — open-source ISA, gaining popularity.


### CISC vs. RISC (simple overview)
CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
Lots of complex instructions — some do a lot of work in one instruction.

Example: x86 has an instruction that can do a whole loop or string copy.

Fewer instructions needed for a program, but each can take multiple clock cycles.
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
Simpler, smaller set of instructions.

Each instruction does one small thing, runs in one clock cycle (ideally).

Makes CPU design simpler, faster, more power-efficient.


Portability
Why can’t a Windows program compiled for Intel run directly on an ARM phone? ISA difference! That’s why you have different binaries or use intermediate bytecode (like Java bytecode) that gets translated.

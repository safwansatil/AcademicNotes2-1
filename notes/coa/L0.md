# Computer Architecture & Computer Organization

<br>

> **CO is the how, CA is the what.**

<br>

### Quick Definition

| Term                           | Definition                                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Computer Architecture (CA)** | The Blueprint & Design Goals              |
| **Computer Organization (CO)** | The Actual Implementation & Assembly Line |

### What Each Does

- **CA** is concerned with **ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)**, which is the language the CPU understands
- **CO** is concerned with the **implementation of the Architect's design**

In other words:

- CA **designs the ISA**
- CO **builds a machine that can execute the ISA**

### Examples

#### Different Architectures

Intel and AMD use **x86 architecture**, while Apple uses **ARM architecture**. These are two completely different languages, and a program compiled for one will not run on the other.

#### Same Architecture, Different Organization

A **Intel Core i7 from 2010** and an **Intel Core i7 from 2020** are both x86 architecture, so they can run the same programs. However, the 2020 version will likely run the same program much faster due to advancements in computer organization. This internal difference is the realm of **CO**.

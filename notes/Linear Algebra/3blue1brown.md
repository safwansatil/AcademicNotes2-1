This note tries to cover essence of linear algebra

and Lecture 1.

span is the set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors. In other words, if you have a set of vectors, the span includes every vector that can be formed by multiplying each of those vectors by a scalar (a real number) and then adding the results together.

Try to think of set of vectors as points in space. The span of those vectors is like the entire area (or volume, or higher-dimensional equivalent) that you can reach by combining those points in different ways.

### Chapter 1
talks about vector definition from cs and physicist perspective. 
Vector needs addition and multiplication operation defined on it.
### Chapter 2
when u have multiple vectors, and u can remove one without reducing the span, then that vector is redundant.
The vectors are then said to be linearly dependent.
Span is the set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors. In other words, if you have a set of vectors, the span includes every vector that can be formed by multiplying each of those vectors by a scalar (a real number) and then adding the results together.
### Chapter 3
Linear transformation, transforms input matrix to output matrix.
Conditions: Lines must remain lines, origin must remain fixed.
tip: u just have to think about where the basis vectors go. rest of the space will follow.

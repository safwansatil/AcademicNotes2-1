span is the set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors. In other words, if you have a set of vectors, the span includes every vector that can be formed by multiplying each of those vectors by a scalar (a real number) and then adding the results together.

Try to think of set of vectors as points in space. The span of those vectors is like the entire area (or volume, or higher-dimensional equivalent) that you can reach by combining those points in different ways.

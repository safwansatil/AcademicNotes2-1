## Theory of Computing

<b>What theory of computing is about?</b>
It is the mathematical study of limits of computation.
It focuses on:

1. What can be computed (Computability Theory), aka can it be done? (like turing machines)
2. How efficiently it can be computed (Complexity Theory), aka how fast can it be done? (like P vs NP)
3. How computation can be modeled (Automata Theory), aka to find out whats the simplest machine we can use? <i>This is like studying the evolution of computing power, from a simple on/off switch to a full-blown modern computer.</i>

Toc is the mathematical foundation that explores the ultimate capabilities and limitations of computers themselves.

### Automata

- Automaton : A self operating machine that performs a predetermined sequence of actions. Plural is Automata.
Formally, Say that A is the language of M1 and that M1 recognizes A and that A = L(M1).

Regular Languages are the class of languages that can be recognized by Finite Automata
